# Why
For people who struggle to start in data science with Python

# Description
This hands-on in-person workshop is based on 
[Python for Data Science Course by IBM Cognitive Class](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/python-for-data-science/)

Learn how to create your first Python scripts
and perform basic hands-on data analysis using Jupyter-based environment.

# Pre-workshop 

You will need a laptop that can access the internet 

## 1: Installation
Install miniconda or install the (larger) Anaconda distribution

[Install Python 3.7 using Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

OR [Install Python 3.7 using Ananconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

## 2: Setup

### 2.1: Download workshop code & materials
Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:aymanibrahim/pyds.git
```
OR [Download the repository as a .zip file](https://github.com/aymanibrahim/pyds/archive/master.zip)

### 2.2: Change directory to pyds
Change current directory to **pyds** directory
```
cd pyds
```
### 2.3: Install Python with required packages
Install Python 3.7 with the required packages into an environment named _pyds_  as per [environment.yml](https://github.com/aymanibrahim/pyds/blob/master/environment.yml) YAML file.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
When conda asks if you want to proceed, type "y" and press Enter.

## 3: Activate environment
Change the current default environment (_base_) into _pyds_ environment.
```
conda activate pyds
```
## 4: Check installation
Use [check_environment.py](https://github.com/aymanibrahim/pyds/blob/master/check_environment.py) script to make sure everything was installed correctly, open a terminal, and change its directory (cd) so that your working directory is the workshop directory _pyds_ you cloned or downloaded. Then enter the following:
```
python check_environment.py
```
If everything is OK, you will get the following message:
> Your workshop environment is set up

## 5: Start JupyterLab
Start JupyterLab using:
```
jupyter lab
```
JupyterLab will open automatically in your browser.

You may access JupyterLab by entering the notebook serverâ€™s URL into the browser.

## 6: Stop JupyterLab
Press **CTRL + C** in the terminal to stop JupyterLab.

## 7: Deactivate environment
Change the current environment (_pyds_) into the previous environment.
```
conda deactivate
```
